# Mobee Mobile App Installation Guide

To make the most of the Mobee Mobile App experience, follow these streamlined steps:

## 1. **Installation:**
   - Download and install the Mobee Mobile App from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/mobee-app/id1617645272) (for iOS devices) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobee_app) (for Android devices).

## 2. **Initial Setup:**
   - Launch the app. Upon opening, a login prompt will appear.
   - Use your Salesforce credentials for logging in.
   - Modify the connection server based on your requirements: choose from Production, Sandbox, or Custom Domain.

## 3. **Confirmation and Access Permissions:**
   - After logging in, you'll receive a confirmation code. Enter this code as prompted.
   - For seamless operation, grant the necessary permissions when requested by the app.

## 4. **Synchronization:**
   - Upon successful login, you'll be greeted with a splash screen detailing the synchronization process.
   - This step's duration varies based on the volume of data to synchronize. 

## 5. **Optimizing Synchronization:**
   - For a faster sync, consider limiting the number of objects you wish to synchronize.
   - Utilize the “List View Filter” and the “File Sync Down” options available in Mobee Object Setup.
     > **Note:** Disabling the “File Sync Down” option will stop files from being downloaded to your device. However, any attachment created by users will still be uploaded.

## 6. **Offline Access:**
   - Once data synchronization is complete, you can access the Home Pages, App Pages, Listviews, and Record Pages entirely offline.
